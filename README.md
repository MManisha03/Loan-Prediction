# Loan-Prediction
This project aims to predict loan approval status based on applicant data using machine learning techniques. The dataset includes features such as income, education, credit history, loan amount, and employment status. After preprocessing, including handling missing values and label encoding, models like Logistic Regression and SVM were trained to classify applications as approved or denied. Logistic Regression achieved 78% accuracy, highlighting patterns that influence loan decisions. This solution helps banks automate the loan evaluation process, improve efficiency, and reduce manual effort while ensuring fair and data-driven lending decisions.
